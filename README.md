# GuessTheNumber

GuessTheNumber is a currently standalone watchOS app that allows the user to guess numbers with the “AI” in the app, or randomize a number, color, or boolean value. The app includes latest technologies including `SwiftUI`, `SF Symbols`, watchOS complications and Siri watch face shortcut donation. GuessTheNumber has also been localized for English and Chinese and I plan to bring Japanese and Russian localization to the app in the future as well. 

## Installation

2. Download [GuessTheNumber](https://testflight.apple.com/join/VJepLWZC) on TestFlight on your iPhone and wait for the app to be loaded onto your Apple Watch.
